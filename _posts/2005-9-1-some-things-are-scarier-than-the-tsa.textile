From "law.com":http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389:

<blockquote>
When FBI supervisors in Miami met with new interim U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta last month, they wondered what the top enforcement priority for Acosta and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales would be. 

Would it be terrorism? Organized crime? Narcotics trafficking? Immigration? Or maybe public corruption? 

The agents were stunned to learn that a top prosecutorial priority of Acosta and the Department of Justice was none of the above. Instead, Acosta told them, it's obscenity. Not pornography involving children, but pornographic material featuring consenting adults.
</blockquote>

It gets better, later, when Acosta reveals that FBI agents from the already-overloaded Crimes Against Children unit will be taken off of cases of child endangerment to work on cases against adult pornographers, by the Attorney General's mandate.

That is _not_ cool.
