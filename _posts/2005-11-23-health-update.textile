Except for the fractures, which are a longer-term issue, my health seems mostly back to normal. I'm sleeping well, eating well, and feeling pretty good considering I have broken bones everywhere.

I'm able to limp around with a walker without pain, although it's pretty exhausting. I'm hoping to be mobile enough to start attending classes again (in a wheelchair, but hey) by next week.
