title: Science. No, really...

Science today is screwed up. Not by the scientists, who are (mostly) honest and self-policing. Not even really by the masses, trying to understand what new discoveries are, and what they mean.

Coming from one side is the government (the traditional source of funding for research that seems totally useless, until it turns into something we can't live without... like, say, the internet...) who is much more interested in spending money on "non-scientific things":http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050910/pl_nm/contracts_dc_1. Even after the scientists "tried to warn them":http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/6/3840/39445 about how to not "need to" spend that much money.

From the other side, the media pretty much "systematically destroys anything scientists try to say":http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/badscience/story/0,12980,1564369,00.html before it can reach the ears of the public.

And that's not even counting the governmentally or commercially funded "scientists" who dispute, in the media, anything that their sponors think is a bad idea.

Bleh.
