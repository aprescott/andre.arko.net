Dear Sony, et al.:

We buy computers because _we_ want to make them do things. Not because we want "you, or anyone else":http://hack.fi/~muzzy/sony-drm/ to "make them do other things":http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html, like keeping us from listening to music... because we paid for it.

Unlike everyone who can listen to it easily because they -stole- downloaded it.


*Update:* "Makes you feel sorry for the people who bought Celine. Well, almost.":/files/ftsonydrm.gif
