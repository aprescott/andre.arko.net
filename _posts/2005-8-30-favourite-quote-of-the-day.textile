"Why do we trust our senses?"

"Because God made us. And he didn't make us _stupid_."


People who put all their effort into convincing people that they "really are religious even though they say they aren't" bother me. Not because I think that people are particularly capable of being completely a-religious (at least, in the sense those people mean it), but because they're about 5 (or 10?) years behind the times.
