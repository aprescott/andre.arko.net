RailsConf is cool; many caboosers are present, and they are also cool. Caboosers got business cards. They are cool business cards, with monkeys on them.

Chicago is not cool, but not too hot, either. About 80&#8211;85&deg;.

Went to dinner at Giordano's, and ate stuffed-crust Chicago-style pizza. It was delicious.

Lots of people had DS Lites, including Amy Hoy and Tobias Luetke; much MarioKart was played. I won twice.

I have started working in earnest on a rails app I will probably manage to finish and release. Releasing is good. This conference is going to be fun. Woohoo.
