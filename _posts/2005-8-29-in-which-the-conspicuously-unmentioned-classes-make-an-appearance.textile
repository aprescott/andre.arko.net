title: In Which The Conspicuously Unmentioned Classes Make An Appearance
layout: post

School is going to be very frustrating this semester. There are a few things I would like to be able to do by the end of the semester:

* Design circuits
* Speak, read and write Japanese
* Excel at programming in "Ruby on Rails":www.rubyonrails.com
* Start consistently doing test-driven development
* Improve the Computer Science department's lab and server to be something less than shameful
* Automate the backing up of my laptop, so it will actually happen, unlike now

(There. Now I have a list to come back to next time I'm bored and don't know what I want to do.)

The really unfortunate part is that all of my classes together will only teach me the first item on that list. The rest of my classes will teach me things I already know, things I don't need to know, or things that I will probably need to know later but aren't that interesting to me now.

Motivation is hard to come by when your classes have conspired to make themselves as uninteresting as possible.
