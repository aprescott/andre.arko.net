title: Mandatory health update

Today my health seems both improved and more stable. My collarbone is less swollen and less painful, and the swelling around my tailbone and pelvis is starting to go down. The nerve pain in my right leg is also fading away, along with the numbness, so it is feeling much closer to normal.

My parents are doing a shopping run for me, so I should have food to eat. That part sounds yummy.

The lawyer has started working on my case, so we'll have to see how that goes.
