title: Strings in Ruby are UTF-8 now

Ruby strings! In Ruby 1.8, Strings were (basically) just arrays of bytes with some extra methods, but Ruby 1.9 added explicit encoding support. Now every string knows how it is encoded! This fixes all of our issues with non-ASCII characters, right? Maybe? Hopefully? Possibly?

Nope. :(

Behold, as narrated by [The String Type Is Broken](http://mortoray.com/2013/11/27/the-string-type-is-broken), exactly how many ways Ruby completely fails to comprehend UTF-8 strings.

```ruby
"noeÌˆl".encoding # => UTF-8
"noeÌˆl".reverse == "leÌˆon" # => false
"noeÌˆl"[0..2] == "noeÌˆ" # => false
"noeÌˆl".length == 4 # => false

"ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¾".encoding # => UTF-8
"ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¾".length == 2 # => true
"ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¾"[1..1] == "ðŸ˜¾" # => true
"ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¾".reverse == "ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¸" # => true

"baï¬„e".encoding # => UTF-8
"baï¬„e".upcase == "BAFFLE" # => false
```

To totally upgrade your ðŸ˜¢ into a full on ðŸ˜­, though, just check out the way that [the Elixir language handles unicode strings](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/d95a7d1a58bddcbbfec62a17c16a53dc1d6a3543/lib/elixir/test/elixir/string_test.exs#L18-L29). I mean, I understand that Erlang is only 5 years older than Ruby is, but I sure wish we had added support for unicode when we added support for strings to claim they are unicode.
