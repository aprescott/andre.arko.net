"TextDrive":http://textdrive.com implemented process limits on their shared servers this weekend. It turns out that editing @dispatch.fcgi@ and explicitly setting the garbage collector is a very bad idea for typo... memory usage goes from 51MB to over 100MB, and then the fcgi process gets killed for exceeding the memory limit.

Figuring this out took two days. Sorry about that.
