Ironically, having survived the plague-ridden hospitals and the flu/holiday season, I got nicely sick today. On the other hand, I can walk, talk, make julianne fries, and do most normal things. As long as they don't involve lifting more than ten pounds, or standing up for more than ten minutes. But hey, progress is great.
