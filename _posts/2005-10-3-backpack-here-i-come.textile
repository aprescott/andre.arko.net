There's a "Backpack Widget":http://www.chipt.com/. This is exciting because it means I don't have to manage all those little reminders and whatnot via web pages...

Ironically, as I find webapps more and more useful, and as ajax makes them more like real programs, I really wish more and more that I have an interface to them that isn't a web browser. At least I have one for Backpack.
