Whee! Going to see "MirrorMask":http://sonypictures.com/movies/mirrormask with "Phil":http://philisha.net and "Joel":http://www.joelmwatson.com/blog and Rachel, and then watch all of "Firefly":http://www.fireflyfans.net and then go see "Serenity":http://www.serenitymovie.com. And have "We Love Katamari":http://katamari.namco.com for playing during the times I'm not watching cool stuff. Plan for a sweet weekend.

Go see both movies this weekend, if you can, so they'll get wider theatrical releases.

Since the world is somehow cooperating with my fantasies this weekend, here is a "simultaneous interview with Time magazine":http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1109313-1,00.html of both "Neil":http://www.neilgaiman.com and "Joss":http://www.whedonesque.com at the same time, talking about their movies and what it's like to not be marginalized and cool for being goofy nerds anymore.
