"Five things Iâ€™d ask every Supreme Court nominee if I sat on the Senate Judiciary Committee":http://www.5ives.com/archives/003097.php

# If you knew to an absolute moral certainty that you could capture and consume a live infant without being caught, how many do you suppose you could eat in a weekend?
# Have you ever been spanked erotically by someone who was not your current legal spouse? Just yes or no, please.
# Nominee, do you regard these slacks as accentuating my basket in an un-senatorial fashion?
# Describe in single words, only the good things that come into your mind aboutâ€¦your mother.
# Kindly rise, and sing the 1979 hit, The PiÃ±a Colada Song, also known as Escape.
