So now that FEMA has finally arrived in the Katrina-ravaged areas, they're taking decisive action:

* No pictures by journalists of anything bad, like "dead people":http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2005-09-07T005629Z_01_N06101601_RTRIDST_0_KATRINA-PHOTOGRAPHS.XML
* "No press _at all_ in the most ravaged areas":http://www.operationflashlight.com/, enforced by the National Guard checkpoints
* No press in the Astrodome (oops. they left "a reporter inside":http://jacob.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/11/, but they have tried to throw him out)
* Actively "jam emergency radio frequencies":http://crawfordpeace.nfshost.com/node/1833
* "Not let the nuclear power plant start back up":http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/07/new_orleans_waterfor.html when it's ready to go
* Order the volunteer firefighters flown in from all over the country to a day of "training on sexual harassment":http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3004197, instead of sending them off to save people who would otherwise die
* Finally send the first group of trained paramedics and firefighters out to... "walk around with the President":http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_09_04.php#006430 while he tours the devastated areas (<a href="http://us.news3.yimg.com/us.i2.yimg.com/p/rids/20050903/i/ra2838142191.jpg?x=380&y=306&sig=nGxy3CvKSMMZUshWzlVoOg--">Picture</a>)
* "Cut emergency communications lines":http://thinkprogress.org/2005/09/04/worst-abandonments/ being used to coordinate rescue and recovery efforts in the worst-hit areas

There's more, but that's enough to be getting on with.
