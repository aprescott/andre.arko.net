title: Trac FCGI URL Frustration
layout: post
---
I've never tried this before, and I kind of doubt anyone who actually knows the answer will see this, but I figure it's worth a shot:

Dear Lazyweb,

Trac (running as an FCGI process under Lighttpd on my TextDrive hosting) insists on putting a prefix url (default /trac/) in front of the actual URL of my trac project. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to be able to access a trac installation at "trac.arko.net", but I am forced to use "trac.arko.net/trac/". The links to stylesheet, images, wiki pages, everything, all stay <code>/trac/link</code>, even though <code>/trac</code> isn't in the configuration anymore. Why, for the love of all that is good and holy, do all the links break if I take out /trac from the FCGI configuration?

Your sincere admirer,<br />
Andre

P.S. Here is the lightty configuration, just in case it might help:
<typo:code>
$HTTP["host"] =~ "^trac.arko.net$" {    
  fastcgi.server = ("/trac" =>
   ("trac" =>
     ( "socket" => "/home/username/var/lighttpd/trac-fcgi.socket",
       "bin-path" => "/usr/local/share/trac/cgi-bin/trac.fcgi",
       "check-local" => "disable",
       "bin-environment" => ("TRAC_ENV" => "/home/username/domains/arko.net/web/trac") )))
}
</typo:code>

*Update:* I am not alone! I am just bad at searching this new-fangled intar-web thingy. Behold, "the Trac ticket for my very problem":http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2418. The downside is that no one's touched it for months. Grr.
