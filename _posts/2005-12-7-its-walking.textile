I managed to hobble around for several minutes today with the aid of my walker. I am pretty optimistic that I will hit the doctor's estimate of being able to walk around by sometime next week. Hopefully that means I will be able to drive myself around soon, and make it to my finals. Nothing else much is happening, except that my health is steadily improving. Yay.
