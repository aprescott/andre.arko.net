[^1]: [from the c2 wiki][c2]: <blockquote>When a function fails it returns an invalid result such as INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE. Then you're supposed to immediately call GetLastError to get the error code [...]. However, if [...] the intervening function does not err, then GetLastError will return ERROR_SUCCESS, which means there was no error, and FormatMessage will return "The operation completed successfully."</blockquote>
