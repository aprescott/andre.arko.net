A direct port of "Lucene":http://lucene.apache.org/ to Ruby, "Ferret":http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac makes indexed searching as easy as it ought to be. That's just very, very cool.

Now if I could only figure out how to easily incorporate Ferret, "Sentry":http://sentry.rubyforge.org/, and "SwitchTower":http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17 into my rails apps, I'd think I was getting good at this.
