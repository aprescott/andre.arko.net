Today, for those who care, my health is markedly improved. I am able to hobble with more ease and less pain, and my overall pain is noticeably reduced. My worries about my school have been resolving nicely -- my professors are being extremely understanding, and it looks like I will be able to finish my schoolwork to complete my current classes with some hard work on my part. If we can find a car to replace my old one, things will be just about as good as they can be.
