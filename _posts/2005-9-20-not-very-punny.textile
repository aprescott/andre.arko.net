Today is just one of those days that needs a terrible pun. So here's my favourite.

bq. One time, there was a legendary explorer who heard about an everliving, landlocked dolphin in the heart of Africa. In fact, it lived so long the natives called it 'The Whale that would not die'. The explorer set off to Africa, and he hired a guide that was familiar with the dolphin. As he was setting out on his journey, his guide told him that to find the porpoise, he would have to have a sacred myna bird on his shoulder. The explorer bought a bird. They traveled about 10 miles from the lake, when they found a dead lion lying in the trail. The guide said they couldn't go on because the lion belonged to the government. The explorer said "Hogwash" and stepped over the beast. Police immediately stepped out from behind some trees and arrested him for 'Transporting a myna across state lions for immortal porpoises.'
