title: Rails Redirect Delay

The "30 second delay":http://www.stupidsimple.org/articles/2005/09/14/running-rails-on-lighttpd-behind-apache2 when you try to proxy lighty through apache and your rails app sends a redirect is really annoying.

And there's no way to fix it short of modifying ActionController. Suck.
