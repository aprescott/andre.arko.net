Well, I'm alive, anyway. I don't like it when people run red lights and t-bone me at 65mph. After five days in the intensive care unit, two chest tubes, and five days in the hospital, I'm down to a broken pelvis, four or five broken ribs, and a broken collarbone. I made it home tonight, but it'll still be at least a couple of weeks before I can get around easily. Hopefully, I'll keep recovering amazingly quickly, and be back to normal soon.
